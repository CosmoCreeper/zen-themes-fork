# Better Toolbar Margins
Zen Browser uses very tight margins. This mod improves both the toolbar and sidebar margins, and fixes various other margins.
Unlike other mods, this has been extensively tested and aims to work with any layout.

> Mods may break in later versions. I use these mods myself, and keep them up-to-date with the latest versions of Zen. If something doesn't work as intended, feel free to [reach out](mailto:roman@rsiebert.dev). Made with 💖 by Roman.
